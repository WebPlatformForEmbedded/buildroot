Buildroot is a simple, efficient and easy-to-use tool to generate embedded
Linux systems through cross-compilation.

The documentation can be found in docs/manual. You can generate a text
document with 'make manual-text' and read output/docs/manual/manual.text.
Online documentation can be found at http://buildroot.org/docs.html

To build and use the buildroot stuff, do the following:

1) run 'make menuconfig'
2) select the target architecture and the packages you wish to compile
3) run 'make'
4) wait while it compiles
5) find the kernel, bootloader, root filesystem, etc. in output/images

This repo consist of mutliple branches:
- Rx (e.g. R4). This is a release branch (the latest release is the default branch)
These are branches on which a certain version of Thunder and it's related components (e.g. plugins and client libraries) are released.
These are tested by QA and when approved for release, a release on that branch is created  (so with a tag to be able to checkout this specific version) 
which includes the QA report. 
Use these branches when a stable version needs to be build (e.g. take the latest released version tag on the R4 branch)
- main: this branch contains the latest contributions but the hashes for packages will not be updated regularly. 
Use this branch when you want to work on some of the packages and typically you would use a local override to bump related packes 
to the latest version (e.g. Thunder and its components)

You do not need to be root to build or run buildroot.  Have fun!

Buildroot comes with a basic configuration for a number of boards. Run
'make list-defconfigs' to view the list of provided configurations.
